## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Native archival

After every earlier stage completes, the controller SHALL archive the change with native OpenSpec archive in the run's worktree, which validates the change, moves it under the archive and applies its spec deltas to the main specs, and SHALL commit the result on the change's branch. When OpenSpec refuses to archive the change, the run SHALL stop at archival, name OpenSpec's output, and commit nothing.

#### Scenario: Change archived
- **WHEN** the run reaches archival with a valid change
- **THEN** the change is moved under the archive, its spec deltas are applied to the main specs, and the result is committed on the change's branch

#### Scenario: Archive refused
- **WHEN** OpenSpec refuses to archive the change, such as when its spec deltas fail validation
- **THEN** the run stops at archival, the report names OpenSpec's output, and the change's branch gains no commit

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Minimal by design

Every mechanism, configuration option and guarantee in the loop SHALL serve a concrete delivery need. The loop SHALL NOT add speculative configuration, plugin points, extra layers, silent fallbacks, or gates and duplicate checks for work a person does by hand. When two designs both meet a need, the loop SHALL use the one with fewer moving parts.

#### Scenario: Manual work during a run
- **WHEN** a person edits or tests something by hand
- **THEN** verifying that work is the person's responsibility, and the loop adds no gate for it

### Requirement: Reviews and verdicts

Each review SHALL end in a recorded `APPROVE` or `REVISE` verdict, and each finding SHALL be classified as blocking or minor. The reviewer SHALL classify the findings, and the loop SHALL derive the verdict from them. A blocking finding means the work fails the review's criteria; a minor finding has a local fix that cannot change behavior or a decision recorded in the design. A review with any blocking finding SHALL be `REVISE`, which requires revision followed by another review. A review with only minor findings SHALL be `APPROVE`: the plan reviser applies minor plan fixes and the implementer applies minor implementation fixes, the required checks run again for implementation, and the approval covers the result. Reviewers SHALL NOT modify the candidate they review. The plan is the change's OpenSpec planning artifacts (proposal, design, spec deltas, tasks) excluding task completion marks. Proposal review SHALL judge whether the whole plan can be implemented and verified as one change without asking the user, and whether it keeps the decisions recorded in the design. An implementation approval covers the change's patch, not the base it applies to. Proposal approval SHALL start implementation automatically, after any minor plan fixes.

#### Scenario: Plan approved
- **WHEN** the proposal reviewer returns `APPROVE`
- **THEN** the controller starts implementation without further user action

#### Scenario: Verdict follows the findings
- **WHEN** a reviewer reports one blocking finding among several minor ones
- **THEN** the recorded verdict is `REVISE`

#### Scenario: Only minor plan findings
- **WHEN** the proposal reviewer finds only minor issues
- **THEN** the verdict is `APPROVE`, the plan reviser applies the fixes, and implementation starts without another proposal review

#### Scenario: Only minor findings
- **WHEN** the implementation reviewer finds only minor issues
- **THEN** the verdict is `APPROVE`, the implementer applies the fixes, the required checks run again, and no further review follows

#### Scenario: Ticking a task box
- **WHEN** the implementer marks a task complete
- **THEN** the plan is unchanged and implementation continues under its approval

#### Scenario: Task instructions changed after approval
- **WHEN** an implementer turn changes approved task instructions or any other part of the plan
- **THEN** the run stops at implementation, names the turn's commit, and does not return to proposal review

### Requirement: Autonomous plan revision

Once a proposal is committed, revising its plan SHALL need no user. When proposal review returns `REVISE`, or the implementer finds that the approved plan needs a change, the plan reviser SHALL revise the plan in a fresh context and the plan SHALL return to proposal review. The implementer SHALL report a needed plan change instead of making it, and an implementer turn that changes the plan SHALL stop the run as a failure of the implementer; the loop compares the plan before and after each turn, so a turn interrupted before it ends is not checked. The reviser SHALL NOT change a decision recorded in the design. A finding or plan problem that needs a decision the plan does not record SHALL stop the run with the question; the user answers by recording the decision in the plan on the run's branch and resuming. A reviewer SHALL raise such a decision as a question on its finding, and any finding with a question SHALL stop the run before the plan is revised.

#### Scenario: Plan review requests changes
- **WHEN** the proposal reviewer returns `REVISE`
- **THEN** the plan reviser revises the plan and the plan is reviewed again, without the user

#### Scenario: Plan cannot be implemented as written
- **WHEN** the implementer finds that the approved plan needs a change
- **THEN** the plan reviser revises the plan, proposal review runs again, and implementation continues after approval

#### Scenario: Decision needed
- **WHEN** a review finding carries a question for a decision the plan does not record
- **THEN** the run stops with the question without revising the plan, and after the user records the decision and resumes, the plan returns to proposal review

### Requirement: Integration and delivery

The run SHALL work on the change's branch. When `loop run` is given on a branch other than the default branch, that branch is the change's branch and the run works in its worktree; when it is given on the default branch, the loop creates the change's branch from that commit in a worktree of its own. The run SHALL preserve unrelated work in every checkout. The base, which the loop integrates the change with and delivers it to, is the remote's default branch in `pr` mode and the local default branch in `local` and `merge` modes. Before archival, the loop SHALL integrate the change with the current base; a conflict or a failed required check SHALL return to the implementer as findings. Only `merge` mode SHALL change the local default branch, and only by fast-forward when every checkout holding it is clean; otherwise the run SHALL stop and name the checkout. Before integrating in `merge` mode, the loop SHALL fast-forward a local default branch that is behind its remote, and SHALL stop the run when it is ahead or has diverged. Every action outside the run's worktree, such as updating or pushing a branch or opening a pull request, SHALL be reported as its own progress line. The configuration SHALL select one delivery mode: `local`, where the run stops with the archived change committed on its branch and pushes nothing; `pr`, where the loop pushes the change branch and opens a pull request on the repository's GitHub remote; or `merge`, where the loop fast-forwards the default branch to the change branch and pushes it. A failed fast-forward or a rejected push SHALL stop the run.

#### Scenario: Run on the default branch
- **WHEN** the user runs `loop run` on the default branch
- **THEN** the loop creates a new branch for the change from that commit in a worktree of its own, and enrollment leaves the default branch and the invoking checkout's files and index untouched

#### Scenario: Run on a change branch
- **WHEN** the user runs `loop run` in a worktree on a branch of its own
- **THEN** the run commits on that branch in that worktree, in every delivery mode

#### Scenario: Local delivery
- **WHEN** the run completes in `local` mode
- **THEN** the archived change is committed on its branch, nothing is pushed and the default branch is untouched

#### Scenario: Pull request delivery
- **WHEN** the run completes in `pr` mode
- **THEN** the change branch is pushed, a pull request is open against the default branch and the local default branch is untouched

#### Scenario: Merge delivery
- **WHEN** the run completes in `merge` mode
- **THEN** the default branch is fast-forwarded to the change branch and pushed

#### Scenario: Clean integration
- **WHEN** the change integrates with a moved default branch without conflicts, its patch is unchanged and the required checks pass
- **THEN** the run continues to archival without another review

#### Scenario: Integration fails
- **WHEN** integration conflicts or a required check fails on the integrated result
- **THEN** the failure returns to the implementer as findings, and the fix is checked and reviewed before archival

#### Scenario: Default branch behind its remote
- **WHEN** in `merge` mode the local default branch is behind its remote and its checkout is clean
- **THEN** the loop fast-forwards it before integrating and reports the fast-forward as a progress line

#### Scenario: Dirty checkout
- **WHEN** the loop needs to change the default branch and a checkout holding it has uncommitted changes
- **THEN** the run stops before changing anything and names the checkout

#### Scenario: Unpushed commits on the default branch
- **WHEN** in `merge` mode the local default branch is ahead of its remote
- **THEN** the run stops instead of publishing those commits

### Requirement: Run control

The loop SHALL provide deterministic `run`, `status`, `stop` and `resume` commands. `run` SHALL exit with a report when the run completes or stops; a stop report SHALL name the step that stopped, the observed cause such as the verdict, check output or exit status, and the recovery available. The loop SHALL NOT investigate failures itself. Stop SHALL end the current step at once. Anything that blocks progression SHALL stop the run and report why, and a stopped run SHALL advance only on an explicit resume. Resume SHALL continue from the first incomplete stage without repeating complete ones. After an interruption around archival, merge, push or pull request creation, resume SHALL inspect the effects that actually happened and SHALL NOT replay them blindly.

#### Scenario: Resume after interrupted merge
- **WHEN** a run was interrupted after its merge completed and the user resumes it
- **THEN** the loop detects the completed merge and does not merge again

#### Scenario: Plan edited while stopped
- **WHEN** a person changes the plan while a run is stopped after implementation completed, and resumes it
- **THEN** the run resumes where it stopped without reviewing the plan again

#### Scenario: Stop
- **WHEN** the user stops a run during an implementer turn
- **THEN** the turn ends, the run reports how to resume, and resume redoes the interrupted step

#### Scenario: Run already exists
- **WHEN** the user runs `loop run` for a change that already has a run
- **THEN** the loop refuses and names `loop status` and `loop resume` for that run

#### Scenario: Advancing process died
- **WHEN** the process advancing a run dies without stopping the run, and the user resumes it
- **THEN** the loop takes over the run and treats the step that was in progress as interrupted

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Pre-archive gate and native archival
**Reason**: Stages run in order, so an incomplete stage never reaches archival, and the loop no longer tracks stale approvals, so the gate has nothing to check. Native archival replaces it.
**Migration**: None. Archival runs native `openspec archive` as before; see Native archival.
